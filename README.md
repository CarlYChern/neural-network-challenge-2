## What it does

* Create a branched neural network with two y's, Attrition and Department.  
These are two branched output layers.
* Predict which employees will leave the company: 1 leaven and 0 stay.
* Predict department suitability: HR, sales and R&D.

## Steps
* Preprocessing.  Create X dataset and two y's.  Convert selected X dataset to 
numeric data types.  Then, perform test_train_split.  Afterwards, encode the 
two y's and StandardScaler on X dataset.
* Create, compile, and train the model.  This is a non-sequential model that 
has two branched output layers.  Two branches are created, one for Attrition 
and one for Department.

## Usage
